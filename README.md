## Comments 
- The Details Fragment (ViewPager) is suffering from this bug: [CoordinatorLayout status bar padding disappears from ViewPager 2nd page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31368781/coordinatorlayout-status-bar-padding-disappears-from-viewpager-2nd-page)
- I didn't add a Shared Element Transition between the photo on the list and on the details because of the ViewPager too, see: [Fragment shared element transitions don't work with ViewPager](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30628543/fragment-shared-element-transitions-dont-work-with-viewpager)
